        <h2>Hindu Demons</h2>
		<p class="p1"> According to <strong>Hindu mythology</strong>, the demons have the same status as humans and Gods. <strong>Gods, demons, 
		and humans</strong> are considered as the children of Brahma who is the creator of the Universe. The only difference between them is 
		the way of thinking and understanding the teachings of the scholars in a different way.
		Some of the demons were considered as strong and intelligent while others were weak and stupid. </p>
		
		<h3>List Of Top 3 Demons</h3>
		<h2>1.Ravana</h2>
		<p class="p2">Ravana was a powerful king of demons with twenty hands and ten heads. He was considered as the most dreadful creature of the universe who can even change the planetary alignments. Ravana was one of the very intellectual demons who mastered all the holy scripts of Hindu mythology. He was killed by Rama as Ravana abducted Rama’s wife Sita to marry her. When Lord Rama killed Ravana, he was more than 12,00,000 years old.<br>

		Ravana was also the first astrologer of the whole world with immense knowledge of Spirituality, Warfare, Arts, Science, and Music. It is also believed that once he made Veena (classical music instrument) and tied his own intestine as strings to praise the Lord. He has the power to clone anyone and had 1 lakh sons out of which 99998 sons were cloned by him. Ravana was also never a teenager, when he was 8 years old his mother convinced his father to grow Ravana as an adult through a technique in which his father had expertise</p>
		<h2>2.Putana</h2>
		<p class="p2">Lord Krishna appeared as a Supreme personality on earth to kill all the demons and protect all his devotees. Putna was the demoness who knew the art of killing infants through black magic. Putna dressed herself as a beautiful girl and entered the infant Krishna’s house to kill him.<br>

		All the women in the village thought that the beautiful girl had come to meet baby Krishna. When Putna entered the room, she saw Krishna lying on the small bed and took him to her lap. The wicked demoness has smeared poison on her breasts and pushed her nipple within his mouth. While she breastfed him, infant Krishna sucked the life out of her. She died of screaming and her body extended up to 12 miles which smashed all the trees and houses.</p>

		<h2>3.Mahabali</h2>
		<p class="p2">Mahabali was one of the very generous demon kings and everybody was very happy in his kingdom. He was a great worshipper of the Lord and wanted people to be happy in his kingdom.<br>
		Once Vamana came to his kingdom and asked for a piece of land that could be covered by his footsteps. Lord Vishnu has disguised himself as Vamana and when Mahabali promised to do so, Vamana increased his size. His footsteps covered the entire world and hence Mahabali asked Vamana to put his third step on his forehead and Mahabali eventually died. This day is celebrated as Onam in many parts of the world</p>
